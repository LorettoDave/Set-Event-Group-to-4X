# Set-Event-Group-to-4X
This is a Visual Studio solution containing C# code that compiles into a DLL to be used in Vegas Pro. 

When run, the script will iterate through all events that start at the same time as the selected event and set their speed to 4x and their length to 1/4, thereby speeding up the selected clip.
